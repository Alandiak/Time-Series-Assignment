# Time-Series-Assignment
Exploring representation and classification.

This was done using a synthetic control data set from the University of California Irvine. The set has 60-time points (60 columns of data) with 6 different classes and values between 0 and 100. It was grouped in order by its classification.

## Running This Project
To run this project, copy the Time Series Project folder to Matlab. Click the play button in the timeSeries.m file to run the program. I was only able to make one graphic display at a time, so uncomment the graphic you want too look at, while commenting the others.
